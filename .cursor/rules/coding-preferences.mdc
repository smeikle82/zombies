# Your rule content

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Ensure detailed comments for the code is added to the codebase where needed
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might arleady have similar code and functionality
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implemenation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implimentation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is only likely to be run once
- Avoid having roles over 300 lines of code. Refactor at this point
